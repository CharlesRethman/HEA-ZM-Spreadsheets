# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS REPOSITORY

In GitHub, files are stored in _repositories_ (often called "repos", for short), which are public and can be viewed by anybody. However, changes can only be made by the **owners** of the repositories.

To obtain a complete carbon-copy of the files in this repository, simply click `download ZIP` and GitHub will send you the download of the latest version in a folder with the repository name (in this case, `hea_zm_spreadsheets`).

If you want to work on the files and change them you will have to **fork** the repository to create a new _branch_. Then you **clone** the file you want to work on to your new branch (always include `zm_expandabilityfactors.xlsx` in the clone) and then, if you and the owner are happy with you changes, you can do a **pull request** to _merge_ the two files together.

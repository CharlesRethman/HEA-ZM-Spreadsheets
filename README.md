# HEA Zambia Baseline Storage Spreadsheets
> Repo: `HEA-ZM-Spreadsheets` on GitHub, `hea_zm_spreadsheets` on local machine

Collection of completed and working Zambian HEA spreadsheets: 17 Baseline Storage Spreadsheets (BSSs) and the Expandability Factors Spreadsheet (EFS).

Any adjustments to Expandability, thresholds, etc. **must** be done at National Level through the Expandability Factors Spreadsheet (`zm_expandabilityfactors.xlsx`), *NOT* through the inidividual Baseline Storage Spreadsheets.

Adjustments to baseline analysis values should be done on the `WB`, `Data`, `Data 2`, `Data 3` and `Data 4` sheets in each BSS.

> **NOTE** It is *HIGHLY* inadvisable to fiddle with or change any formulae in these sheets and it is even more inadvisable to add or delete rows or columns in _any_ sheet. If you do, you will face numerous unintended consequences. **_You have been warned: do this entirely at your own risk!_**

For instructions on how to use GitHub and Git with these spreadsheets, see INSTRUCTIONS.md.
